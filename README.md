# User Search and Update Project

This project is a web application built with React on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend. It allows users to search for and update user data stored in a SQL database. Axios is used for making HTTP requests between the frontend and backend.

## Features

- **User Search**: Users can search for specific users in the database by their unique ID.
- **User Update**: Once a user is found, their information can be updated and saved back to the database.
- **Responsive Design**: The web application is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend server.
  
- **Backend**:
  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
  - Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
  - SQL Database: A relational database management system for storing user data.
